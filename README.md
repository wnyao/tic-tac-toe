Tic-Tac-Toe with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) is an advance iteration based on this initial React's [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). With the mind to learn React, I followed through the tutorial and further reiterate the project with additional features and stylings. Currently, the web app is responsive on pc browser, but not so much on mobile devices. 

This project will be used for both experimental and learning purposes. Feel free to let me know if you have some cool idea on features, knowledges on best practices, or any improvement that you think can apply to the project. I will work on it when I find some free times.
